<p><strong>Metronome Consent form:</strong></p>
<p>The aim of this study is to examine Rhythmic perception in different modalities.</p>
<p>During the experiment, you will be required to tap on the phone screen according to the instructions you receive. The experiment contains 3 parts:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Tap in a constant comfortable temp for 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Tapping according to external tempi you will <strong>hear</strong> in your headphones</li>
    <li>Tapping according to external tempi you will <strong>feel</strong> through your phone vibration</li>
</ol>
<p>(The order may alternate between the modalities).</p>
<p>The entire experiment lasts 20 minutes.</p>
<p>You must have <strong>android Cellphone &amp; Headphones</strong> before you start the experiment (Apple products will not work).</p>
<p>There are no particular risks for the experiment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will not take direct advantage from the research, but thanks to your collaboration we'll be able to shed light on the mechanisms of perception, its limits, and capacities, thus enabling us and future researchers to influence them and, eventually, correct malfunctioning.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee maximal privacy, your personal data will be encrypted and stored anonymously and separately from identifying data.</p>
<p>You may stop the experiment at any moment and for any reason, and there will be no consequences for leaving. You will receive the minimum payment guaranteed for taking part in the experiment if you decide to leave.</p>
